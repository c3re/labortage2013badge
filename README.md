# HOTP-USB-Generator / labortage2013badge
http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/LaborTageBadge2013

This is a fork of LaborTageBadge2013 from Das Labor in Bochum. This Project is, as of now, 4 years old and hasn't been touched since.
I forked the project and changed the Pins of the USB-Data Pins and altered the Code in a way that 3 tokens are sent immediately after
insertion of the USB-Stick. With the Pin Header modification you can flash the software onto a Digispark Digistump which costs 1-2$ per piece.
In addition to that i added a 3d-case stl-file which was designed by a c3re-member (thx et merci).
